<h1>Connecting a logger</h1>

<b>WARNING</b> As with any USB memory stick type
device there is a risk the logger could contain malware such as
viruses or trojans which may be invisibly installed on the computer.
It is STRONGLY ADVISED you read the help item <b>Protecting against
malware</b> and implement the suggested permanent solution, especially
before first connecting to any logger.

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b> When a championship organizer is inspecting and
configuring loggers before a championship it should be expected that
all loggers presented by pilots shall have NO DATA on them.  All data
subsequently added to the logger will therefore only be associated with the
championship and not mixed in with loads of tracks from earlier
flights.

<p>There is deliberately no function in FRDL for completely
wiping a logger so this should be done manually using
Windows Explorer or equivalent.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b> Once connected, do NOT disconnect or un-plug the
    logger until FRDL says 'You may disconnect the logger'.</p>

<p>Premature disconnection while data is being transferred can lead
to unrecoverable data corruption.  The same thing applies when
removing a SD card from a logger; the logger MUST be switched off first.

<h2>Connecting a logger</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Connect the logger to FRDL by either by plugging it into a USB port
    or placing the SD card in a suitable slot.</li>
    <li>Within a few seconds FRDL should automatically identify that something
    has been connected.</li>

    <li><b>If FRDL recognizes it as a 'known' logger:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>FRDL will back up the entire contents of the logger.</li>
        <li>FRDL will create a .igc file according to the CIMA specification
        and save it to the location defined in <b>Settings - Championship</b></li>
        <li>FRDL will display a A basic outline of the track, its height profile
        and some statistics.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>If FRDL does not recognize the logger:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>FRDL will ask you what you want to do.</li>
            <li>Depending on the precice configuration of both FRDL and the logger
            you may be asked if you want to add the logger to this championship 
            or to go into Download only mode.  For further information see the 
            <b>Modes of operation</b> help item.</li>
            <li>If you chose an option which allows the logger to be recognized
            then FRDL will back up the logger Etc. as normal.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
