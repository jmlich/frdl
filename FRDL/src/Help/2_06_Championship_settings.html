<h1>Championship settings</h1>

<p>If this is a new championship, then you will automatically be 
brought to the Championship settings page.  Otherwise, with a 
championship file open, select <B>Settings - Championship</B> from the 
main menu.

<h2>Championship name</h2>
Enter the name of your championship.

<h2>Password</h2>

For every-day use, leave this blank.  A blank password means FRDL will 
normally operate in full mode.  (see <B>Modes of operation</B>).
<p>
A championship organizer should set a password at the beginning of 
the championship and before any loggers are connected.  This will 
configure the logger to tell any instances of FRDL it is connected to 
with the wrong password to go into Download-only mode. (see <B>Modes 
of operation</B>).
<p>
At the end of a championship, the organizer may choose to release 
the password which can be used to set any instance of FRDL back into 
full mode.

<h2>Local time offset from UTC</h2>

FRDL operates entirely in UTC because logger data is always in UTC.  
For convenience, both championship and task windows may be set to the 
local time as configured by this offset.  It has no effect on the time 
written to the .igc output file.

<h2>Adjust output IGC file times to local</h2>

Normally this should <B>NOT</B> be checked.  This means that all data written 
to output .igc files will always be UTC which is the normal convention.
<p>
There are however situations when a conversion to local time is convenient.  
The most notable is when the championship is occurring in a location in the 
Far East when it is possible normal daytime flights might occur across 
midnight UTC.  This is not a problem for FRDL, but there is a problem 
in the output .igc file format which does not easily account for a date 
change and analysis software can get confused when it encounters a time 
going from 23:59:59 to 00:00:00.  Conversion to local time solves this.  
<p>
Before setting this, organizers should consider that the software used to 
download other types of loggers such as the MLR may NOT be capable of 
inserting a similar local time offset.  The fact that you may end up 
with some files which do have an offset included, and some which don't may 
outweigh the convenience of being able to set an offset in FRDL.

<h2>Overall championship window</h2>

This should be set to include the entire championship period.  FRDL will 
ignore all tracks it finds on a logger which lie entirely outside this 
period.  Task windows in FRDL cannot be set outside the championship 
window.

<h2>Output path to analysis</h2>
<p>
Analysis software generally requires its source data to be in one place.  
All .igc output files will be saved to this location.

<h2>Automatic backups</h2>

A backup of the previous championship settings is always made before 
changes to championship settings are saved.  Backup files are saved 
in the same folder as the championship file and renamed in the format 
YYYYMMDDhhmm_original_file_name.bak
<p>
To revert to a backed up championship settings file, simply rename the
file extension from .bak to .frdc and open it in FRDL.
