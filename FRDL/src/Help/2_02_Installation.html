<h1>Installing FRDL</h1>

<table class="info">
<tr><td>
FRDL is a Java application which means it can work on any operating system which
has Java installed on it. You probably have Java already installed; FRDL
requires you to have at least <b>Java version 1.5</b> but ideally you should
have version 1.6.  If you do not have Java or you need an update, it is available
from<br>
<A href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</A></b>.
<br>
You will need the <b>Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)</b>.</td>

</table>

<h2>Installing FRDL on a PC</h2>

FRDL has been tested on Windows 2000, XP and Vista.

<p>
    <b>Windows</b> Download the file <b>setup FRDL xxx.exe</b> to your computer from
    <A href="http://www.flymicro.com/frdl">www.flymicro.com/frdl</A> and
    double click on it to run the installer.
<p>
    <b>Other operating systems</b> (and Windows, if the above doesn't work). Download
    the file <b>setup FRDL xxx.jar</b> to your computer from
    <A href="http://www.flymicro.com/frdl">www.flymicro.com/frdl</A> and
    double click on it to run the installer.   (A .jar file is actually
    just a zip file recognizable to Java, but the .jar installer may not work correctly
    on Vista...)
<p>
    In both cases the xxx indicates the version. Versions of FRDL up to and including
    0.24 should be uninstalled before installing a newer version.  For versions 0.25
    and greater it is perfectly OK to install over an earlier version of FRDL.  In either
    case no configuration files, logger files or output igc files will be affected.
<p>

 <table class="important">
<tr><td>
    On Vista you may still get a message from the "Program
    compatibility assistant": <i>"This program might not have installed correctly"</i>
    with the Details: IzPack SFX, publisher: Igor Pavlov, Julien Ponge.  This is
    OK, they are the authors of the installer and probably FRDL has actually installed
    OK.
<p>
    The installer does  nothing 'clever' except to put the required files in a place
    of your choice and creates shortcuts so you can easily start FRDL.</td>
<td><img src="icon_important.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Important" valign="top"></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Uninstalling FRDL on a PC</h2>

    Select <b>Uninstall FRDL</b> from the start menu.
<p>
    If, for some reason this does not work, search your system for FRDL.jar and
    delete the folder it is in along with all it's sub-folders, and any shortcuts pointing
    at these folders (eg in your START menu).  FRDL is now  completely removed from
    your system.
<p>
    Uninstalling FRDL will not affect any of the championship files, logger backups
    or .igc files it may have made while in use.
    
<h2>Installing and uninstalling FRDL on Mac, Linux, Solaris Etc.</h2>

    In principle, FRDL should install, work and uninstall on all these platforms,
    however it is known that FRDL does not work on a Mac and this is a work in
    progress.    I
<p>
    FRDL is currently not tested on any other OS.  The developer would be
    interested to hear of any experiences of attempts to use FRDL on them.
