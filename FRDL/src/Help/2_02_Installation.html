<h1>Installing FRDL</h1>

FRDL is a Java application which means it can work on any operating system which 
has Java installed on it. You probably have Java already installed; FRDL
requires you to have at least <b>Java version 5</b> but ideally you should
have version 6.  If you do not have Java or you need an update, it is available
from <b>http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</b>.
<br>
You will need the <b>Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)</b>.

<h2>Installing FRDL on a PC</h2>

FRDL has been tested on Windows 2000, XP and Vista.

<p>
    Download the file FRDL-xxx.jar file to your computer. (the xxx indicates the
    version).  (A .jar file is actually just a zip file recognizable to Java.)
<p>
    If you are installing a newer version of FRDL then it is recommended you
    completely uninstall the old version first.  This will ensure you only have
    one set of shortcuts to FRDL.
<p>
    Double click on FRDL-xxx.jar to start the FRDL installer. This installer does
    nothing 'clever' except to put the required files in a place of your choice and
    creates shortcuts so you can easily start FRDL.

<h2>Uninstalling FRDL on a PC</h2>

    Select <b>Uninstall CIMA FRDL</b> from the start menu.
<p>
    If, for some reason this does not work, search your system for FRDL.jar and
    delete the folder it is in along with all it's sub-folders.  FRDL is now
    completely removed from your system.
<p>
    Uninstalling FRDL will not affect any of the championship files, logger backups
    or .igc files it may have made while in use.
    
<h2>Installing and uninstalling FRDL on Mac, Linux, Solaris Etc.</h2>

    In principle, FRDL should install, work and uninstall on all these platforms,
    however it is known that FRDL does not work on a Mac and this is a work in
    progress.    I
<p>
    FRDL is currently not tested on any other OS.  The developer would be
    interested to hear of any experiences of attempts to use FRDL on them.
