<h1>FRDL release notes</h1>

<p><b>0.27</b> 20 Apr 2009:
<br>
Pilot EVents (PEVs) now shown as a circular icon on the map where the
MARK button was pressed.<br>
If the location where igc files are saved is unavailable (eg on a network drive)
then they are saved to the same folder as the championship file and an error
message is displayed.<br>
Session properties relocated to the root of the user's working directory in a
file named <b>FRDL_session_Properties</b> which should not now cause problems
on Vista.<br>
Added a 'quick access' item to the File menu to quickly open the last
championship file.<br>
Added a new Help item <b>File locations</b> which explains which files
are read and saved by FRDL.<br>
The user's local timezone offset is placed in the local time offset fields of a
new championship.  Of course the user could have the wrong timezone set in his
OS, but 99% of the time it will be correct.<br>
A large selection of accented characters replaced with ASCII non-accented
equivalent in pilot names.<br>
Line endings in igc files are now CRLF and not just LF so the file meets the
CIMA spec and they will open in OziExplorer...<br>



<p><b>0.26</b> 9 Apr 2009:
<br>
Displays fix validity by colour in the track display.<br>
Will write an igc file even if the logger is in the wrong mode 
and not recording altitude or fix validity.<br>
If one is detected, writes a date change to the igc file as per the CIMA spec.<br>
Help improvements.<br>


<p><b>0.25</b> 28 Mar 2009:
<br>
Revised the installer now using Packjacket / izPack<br>
    - .exe installer so it installs correctly on Vista.<br>
    - no need to uninstall earlier versions.

<p><b>0.24</b> 28 Mar 2009:
<br>
Added splash screen.

<p><b>0.23</b> 26 Mar 2009:
<br>
Revision of warning introduced in 0.22

<p><b>0.22</b> 26 Mar 2009:
<br>
Improved support for GeoChron
<br>
Improved error trapping for unrecognized NMEA lines
<br>
Added warning if a task is set to extend over more than
one UTC day.  No problem for FRDL, but can be a problem in
the output igc file format because there is no
properly defined way of changing day half way through
a track, therefore some analysis programs may
show the portion of track after midnight BEFORE the
portion of track before midnight...

<p><b>0.21</b> 25 Mar 2009:
<br>
Non contiguous tracks are displayed with gaps if the
gap is more than 30 sec.
