<h1>Connecting a logger</h1>

<b>WARNING</b> As with any USB memory stick type
device there is a risk the logger could contain malware such as
viruses or trojans which may be invisibly installed on the computer.
It is STRONGLY ADVISED you read the help item <b>Protecting against
malware</b> and implement the suggested permanent solution, especially
before first connecting to any logger.

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b> When a championship organizer is inspecting and
configuring loggers before a championship it should be expected that
all loggers presented by pilots shall have NO DATA on them.  All data
subsequently added to the logger will therefore only be associated with the
championship and not mixed in with loads of tracks from earlier
flights.

<p>There is deliberately no function in FRDL for completely
wiping a logger so this should be done manually using
Windows Explorer or equivalent.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b> Once connected, do NOT disconnect or un-plug the
    logger until FRDL says 'You may disconnect the logger'.</p>

<p>Premature disconnection while data is being transferred can lead
to unrecoverable data corruption.  The same thing applies when
removing a SD card from a logger; the logger MUST be switched off first.

<h2>Connecting a logger</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Connect the logger to FRDL by either by plugging it into a USB port
    or placing the SD card in a suitable slot.</li>
    <li>Within a few seconds FRDL should automatically identify that something
    has been connected.</li>

    <li><b>If FRDL recognizes it as a 'known' logger:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>FRDL will perform some management exercises on files on the logger (see below).
        <li>FRDL will back up the entire contents of the logger.</li>
        <li>FRDL will create a .igc file according to the CIMA specification from data 
        it finds on the logger which lies within the active task window, and saves
        it to the location defined in <b>Settings - Championship</b></li>
        <li>FRDL will display a A basic outline of the track, its altitude profile
        and some statistics.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>If FRDL does not recognize the logger:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>FRDL will ask you what you want to do.</li>
            <li>Depending on the precice configuration of both FRDL and the logger
            you may be asked if you want to add the logger to this championship 
            or to go into Download only mode.  For further information see the 
            <b>Modes of operation</b> help item.</li>
            <li>If you chose an option which allows the logger to be recognized
            then FRDL will write a configuration file to the logger which allows
            it to be recognized in future, and will then back up the logger, create
            an output .igc file according to the active task specification and
            display an outline of the track as normal.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

<h2>The track and altitude display</h2>

Once the track has been saved to the output .igc file, FRDL displays
a <b>basic outline</b> of the track, its altitude profile and some statistics.
<p>
This is intended as a 'quick and dirty' indication of what has been saved and
NOT any kind of definitive flight analysis which should be done in a
dedicated flight analysis program (eg MicroFlap).
<p>
It is probably good enough for both the organizer and the pilot to clearly
understand what was recorded by the logger so it can be immediately returned to him.
<p>
It may also indicate basic problems such as poor reception which can be
improved by the pilot placing the logger in a better place in his aircraft
next time.  It may also alert the organizer to important penalties such
as outlandings which merit further detailed investigation.
<p>
Gaps in a track are shown whenever there is no data for a period of 30 seconds or more.
<p>
The displayed start and end times are the first and last log file entries which
FRDL found within the task window.  They are NOT takeoff or landing times.
<p>
The max and min altitude are what FRDL found from amongst all log file entries
within the task window, and may not indicate max and min altitudes flown since
GPS receivers can easily generate false altitudes particularly whan they are starting up
and when they have poor reception.  Even with good reception, GPS altitude can easily
show an error over true altitude of 500ft or more, so it should always be used in
flight analysis as nothing more than a general indicator.  For example, the altitude
profile of a flight may clearly show an outlanding, but before being penalized this
should always be further investigated by looking at such things as the distance between
fixes or speed at the location of the supposed outlanding.

<h2>Logger file management</h2>

Every time a logger is connected, FRDL deletes any AUTORUN.INF files or folders
it finds and creates an AUTORUN.INF folder containing a README.TXT file which briefly
describes why it does this and when it did it.  See <b>Protecting against malware</b>
for more info on this. Do not place any files inside this AUTORUN.INF folder
as FRDL will always delete them all without warning!
<p>
Some types of logger, for example the GeoChron, require a settings file to be on
the logger which tells the logger things like what type of data it should log and the
frequency it should log fixes at.  FRDL always re-writes this file to the
logger so it is correctly configured for CIMA championships the next time it is used.
<p>
Some types of logger, for example the Geochron, do not create unique log file names
but a simple series such as Log0.txt, Log1.txt Log2.txt Etc.  To avert the
possibility of duplicate log file names getting into the FRDL backup system, FRDL
renames these files <b>on the logger</b> with a unique file name based
on current date-time <b>before</b> it backs up the files.  Say there is a Log0.txt and
a Log1.txt on the logger when you return from a flight.  FRDL will rename
these to something like 20090319072133_Log0.txt and 20090319072133_Log1.txt before it
backs them up and processes them.  The next time the logger is started, it will totally
ignore these files, see there is no Log0.txt and create one with the new log data
inside it.  The data inside the 20090319072133_Log0.txt and 20090319072133_Log1.txt
is not affected at all.
<p>
Because all the loggers FRDL is compatible with behave exactly like ordinary memory
sticks it is prefectly possible for you to put other files like photos or documents
on them.  This is not advisable because it will reduce the memory available for your
log files, but otherwise FRDL will completely ignore them and it will <b>NOT</b> back them
up.  FRDL knows that an AMOD writes its log files with <i>.log</i> as the file extension
or a Geochron writes them with <i>.txt</i> as the file extension and it will ignore files
with any other file name extension on that logger apart from the configuration file
which is always named <i>logger.frdl</i>
