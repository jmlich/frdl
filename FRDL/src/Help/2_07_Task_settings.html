<h1>Task settings</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>

Select the task number to inspect the task window of that task.

<h2>Task window</h2>

FRDL ignores all track fixes it finds on the logger which lie 
outside the task period, or 'window' of the currently active task.
<p>
The ones it finds inside the task window it will write to the 
eventual output .igc file.
<p>
By default, a task window is the entire championship window (see 
<B>Championship settings</B>) but the people doing the flight 
analysis would find it very inconvenient to have to analyse track 
files which contain many flights within this period.  There are also
significant technical issues in analysing flights extending over
more than one day.  (See <b>Adjust output IGC file times to local</b> in
<b>Championship Settings</b>.)
<p>
Because the task window in a championship is always known from 
the task brief, before any loggers are downloaded with the 
intention of analysing a task, the task window should be set
to encompass the entire task window.  This way, only flights made 
by each pilot in that task are saved to the output .igc file.
<p>
As flights which either begin before, or finish after a briefed 
task window are usually penalized, it may be advisable to add a 
bit to the window setting either side of the 'briefed' task window
(eg 1 hour each side) which will enable the analysis people to 
identify flights which should be penalized.

<h2>The activate button</h2>

This sets the currently active task and all output .igc files 
will be generated from fix points which lie within the active 
task window.
<p>
If a different task is activated while a logger is connected then the
logger data will be re-processed according to the newly activated
task.

<h2>"Virtual" task numbers</h2>

It is important to note that the CIMA output file specification 
includes the task number in the output file name, and it is 
important for some analysis programs that the correct task number 
is in the file name.
<p>
In the situation where you have two different classes of aircraft 
both flying the same task number, but in different time windows, it 
is probably NOT a good idea to use different task numbers (eg '2' for 
one class and '22' for another.).  Instead, it is probably better 
to download all loggers in task 2 for class A and then change the 
task window time settings and repeat for class B.
<p>
This will keep all the output files generated for task 2 intact
according to the CIMA output file specification, but of course extra 
care must be taken to ensure each logger is being downloaded in 
the correct task window for the class.
