<h1>Installing FRDL</h1>


FRDL requires <b>Java version 6</b> to be installed on your computer, and it probably
is already. It may also work on version 5.  If you do not have Java or you need
an update, it is available from
<b>http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</b>.
<br>
You need the <b>Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)</b>.

<h2>Installing FRDL on a PC</h2>

FRDL has been tested on Windows 2000, XP and Vista.

<p>
    Download the file FRDLxx.zip file to your computer. (the xx indicates the
    version).
<p>
    Unzip the contents of the file to a location of your choice on your computer.
    The folder thus created should contain the file <b>FRDL.jar</b> and the
    sub-folder <b>lib</b> containing various libraries FRDL needs to run.
<p>
    Double click on FRDL.jar to start FRDL.   It is recommended a shortcut is
    created and placed in a convenient place such as the desktop.

<h2>Uninstalling FRDL on a PC</h2>

    Delete the folder containing the file <b>FRDL.jar</b> and the
    sub-folder <b>lib</b>.
    <br>
    Delete any shortcuts you may have made to FRDL.jar
    <br>
    FRDL is now completely removed from the PC.



<h2>Installing FRDL on Mac, Linux, Solaris Etc.</h2>

    In principle, FRDL should work on all these platforms, however it is
    currently not tested on any of them.  It is known that FRDL will only 
    partially work on a Mac, getting to to work properly is a work in progress.
<p>
    The developer would be interested to hear of any experiences of using FRDL
    on non-Windows platforms.
