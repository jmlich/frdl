<h1>Logger settings</h1>

Logger settings are only available when a logger is connected.  <B>Do 
NOT disconnect a logger while the logger settings window is open.</B>
<p>
In Download-only mode all logger settings are read-only  (see <B>Modes of 
operation</B>).

<h2>Logger</h2>

The FRDL Id is the unique identifier FRDL gives to a logger the first 
time it is connected to FRDL. It is never editable.
<p>
The correct type of logger MUST be selected as the data retrieved from it 
may otherwise not be processed correctly.
<p>
The CIMA approval status of each type of logger is displayed.  Approved
loggers MUST be used in FAI championships unless CIMA has
specifically issued an exemption, (possibly with conditions) for a
unapproved logger type to be used in that championship.

<h2>Pilot</h2>

These fields must all be filled in correctly as they are used to generate 
the correct .igc output file according to the CIMA Specification.
<p>
<B>Name</B>: The usual protocol is to use the same name as used in the 
analysis and scoring systems which should be in the format Given Name <I>(lower case)</I> 
FAMILY NAME <I>(upper case)</I>.
<p>
<B>Nation</B>: The usual protocol is to use the FAI three letter code.  
(FAI uses the Olympic system which is slightly different to the ISO system, eg
ISO - DEU = FAI - GER).
<p>
<B>Competition number</B>: The competition number of the pilot.  Must be less 
than 999 to meet the CIMA Specification.
<p>
<B>Primary secondary Etc.</B>:  Pilots often carry more than one logger on 
a competition flight.  This identifies which logger this one is.  The normal 
convention is that only the data from the pilot's primary logger is used in 
analysis unless there was some sort of technical fault in which case the 
secondary data is used.
<p>
Operators should be careful not to register pilots with duplicate
primary or secondary loggers as this could cause confusion in the flight analysis.
If in doubt, cancel any settings changes and check the list of registered loggers
from the Info menu.  Note this will not be a definitive list if the pilot is
using another logger type which cannot be downloaded by FRDL such as an MLR,
so check the list of registered loggers in that software too.

<h2>Save</h2>

Saves the information to the Championship configuration file and the
configuration file on the logger.
