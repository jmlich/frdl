<h1>AMOD 3080</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<IMG SRC="amod_with_arrows.jpg" WIDTH="309" HEIGHT="251" ALT="" BORDER="0">
<BR>
<p>The AMOD 3080 has two buttons:</p>
<br>ON/OFF and MARK

<p>Three separate indicator lights: </p>
<br>
Red: Storage full, Green: GPS status, Amber: Battery power.

<h2>Basic operation</h2>

<h3>SWITCH ON</h3>

Press the Power ON/OFF button until all three LED's blink
simultaneously once.  The green LED will stay constant while it is searching for a GPS signal.</p>

<p>
While the Green LED is blinking it is tracking GPS satellites and is logging GPS data.</p>

<p>
If the green LED goes to constant on then you have lost GPS
reception; adjust its orientation and position until the green LED is blinking
again.</p>

<h3>MARK</h3>

Depress the MARK button briefly to record a specific point
on the track.� The red LED will flash briefly to confirm the point has been
recorded.</p>

<h3>LOW BATTERY �</h3>

The amber battery power LED will start to blink when there
is approximately 20% battery power remaining, but it will continue logging.
<p>
When the battery power LED goes to constant, there is no longer sufficient
power to continue logging and no further logging will take place until the
batteries are replaced.

<h3>STORAGE FULL </h3>

The red LED will be constantly on and no further logging
will take place. The device has a minimum 72 hours of track storage capacity
so there is no excusable reason why you could ever reach this status.</p>

<h3>SWITCH OFF </h3>

Press the Power ON/OFF button until all three LED�s blink
simultaneously once and then all go out.</p>

<h3>BATTERIES� </h3>

3 x AAA.� Endurance with good quality alkaline batteries is
minimum 7 hours.</p>

<p><span style='color:red'><b>Manufacturer warning:</b> Inserting batteries the wrong way around will cause
permanent damage to the device.</span></p>

<h2>Advanced operation</h2>

<h3>GPS RESET </h3>

If it is a long time since you used it, or you have moved to
a different part of the World since you last used it, it may take a very long time
to start logging after being switched on. In this case you can force a GPS
reset by pressing the MARK button for about 5 seconds.  It will then acquire new 
GPS Epheremis data and should start logging within a minute or two.
</p>

<h3>LOGGER SETUP </h3>

There are six operating modes. <B>Mode 1</B> is the device default
and is also the setting you should use in championships for best results.</p>

<p>
To enter setup, switch on the AMOD and wait until it is
logging normally.� Then hold both the ON/OFF button and the MARK button
simultaneously for about 5 seconds.� When all three LED's flash three times,
release both buttons; you have entered setup mode.</p>

<p>
Cycle through each mode by pressing the MARK button. The
LED which is lit or blinking indicates the mode you have selected. </p>

<p>
When you are in the desired mode, press the ON/OFF button
until the device powers down.� The next time you start it, it will be in the
mode you selected.</p>

<p>
<b><span style='color:red'>Warning: </span></b><span
style='color:red'>�There are three modes (2, 4 &amp; 6)� which are 
NOT compatible with FRDL and should NOT be used in championships because 
the logger will not be recording any altitude or fix validity
information.</span></p>

<p>Notes</p>
<ol>
<li>If no button is pressed after about one minute in setup mode, the current selected
setting is saved and the device powers off.</p>

<li>If
the battery power is low, (Battery power LED blinking) then any attempt to
enter setup mode will power off instead.</p>

<li>As
you cycle through the modes, then the currently selected mode is the one saved,
so if the batteries are removed during setup mode then the next restart will be
in the mode you were in at the moment of power loss and NOT the mode before you
entered setup mode.
</ol>

<h3>LOGGER RESET� </h3>

<p>To entirely wipe the logger memory, enter Setup mode and
then press the MARK button for about 5 seconds when all three LED�s will start
to blink sequentially.� When the MARK button is released the logger memory will
be entirely wiped empty.</p>

<p>Notes</p>
<ol>
<li>After
you have done this, enter setup mode again to ensure it is still in the mode
you expect it to be in.</p>

<li>It
is easier to wipe the memory by simply deleting all files from the device with
a file explorer while it is connected to a computer.</p>
