<h1>Errors</h1>

FRDL has a 'hidden' pane between the status bar and the 
altitude profile window which may be expanded by 
dragging it upwards.
<p>
This pane lists many errors which might be encountered.
<p>
If you encounter a repeatable error, please get in touch 
with the developer with a description of how and when it 
occurs and he will endeavour to create a fix as soon 
as possible.
