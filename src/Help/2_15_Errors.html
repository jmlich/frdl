<h1>Errors</h1>

FRDL has a 'hidden' window pane between the status bar and the
altitude profile pane which may be expanded by
dragging it upwards with your mouse.
<p>
This pane displays what FRDL has been doing as well as 
displaying any errors it encountered.
<p>
<table class="important">
<tr><td>
If you encounter a repeatable error, please get in touch
with the developer with a description of how and when it
occurs and he will endeavour to create a fix as soon
as possible.</td>
<td><img src="icon_important.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Important" valign="top"></td></tr>
</table>
