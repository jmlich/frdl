Since FRDL backs  up all files it finds on each logger to sub-folders
it creates in the same folder as the championship configuration file,
it is strongly recommended you create a new championship in <b>a new empty folder</b>.</td>

<ul>
    <li>Select <b>File - New Championship</b>.</li>
    <li>Select a location for this championship on your computer.</li>
    <li>Enter a file name for your championship and click OK.  The 
    championship configuration file thus generated will have the
    file name extension <b>.frdc</b></li>
    <li>You will be taken to the <b>Championship settings</b> page.</li>
    <li>And then the <b>Task settings</b> page.</li>
    <li>FRDL will display <b>Waiting for logger...</b></li>

<tr><td>
When a championship organizer is inspecting and
configuring loggers before a championship it should be expected that
all loggers presented by pilots shall have NO DATA on them.  All data
subsequently added to the logger will therefore only be associated with the
championship and not mixed in with loads of tracks from earlier
flights.
<p>
There is deliberately no function in FRDL for completely
wiping a logger so this should be done manually using
Windows Explorer or equivalent.

<table class="warning">
<tr><td>
Do NOT put your new championship configuration file in the same folder as the
FRDL application file FRDL.jar or any sub-folder of that location because an uninstall or update
of FRDL may destroy them.  Since the application files are placed by default
in "Program files" or equivalent, your operating system won't usually let you
do this anyway, so it should not be a problem.</td>

<table class="warning">
<tr><td>
As with any USB memory stick type
device there is a risk a logger could contain malware such as
viruses or trojans which may be invisibly installed on the computer.
It is STRONGLY ADVISED you read the help item <b>Protecting against
malware</b> and implement the suggested permanent solution
before first connecting to any logger.</td>
