<h1>New championship</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Select <b>File - New Championship</b>.</li>
    <li>Select a location for this championship on your computer.  Since FRDL backs
    up all files it finds on each logger it is recommended the location is in
    <b>a new empty folder</b>.</li>
    <li>Enter a file name for your championship and click OK.  The file thus
    generated will end with the file name extension <b>.frdc</b></li>
    <li>You will be taken to the <b>Championship settings</b> page.</li>
    <li>And then the <b>Task settings</b> page.</li>
    <li>FRDL will display <b>Waiting for logger...</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>WARNING</b> As with any USB memory stick type
device there is a risk the logger could contain malware such as
viruses or trojans which may be invisibly installed on the computer.
It is STRONGLY ADVISED you read the help item <b>Protecting against
malware</b> and implement the suggested permanent solution, especially 
before first connecting to any logger.

<p>
    <b>IMPORTANT</b> When a championship organizer is inspecting and
configuring loggers before a championship it should be expected that 
all loggers presented by pilots shall have NO DATA on them.  All data
subsequently added to the logger will therefore only be associated with the
championship and not mixed in with loads of tracks from earlier 
flights.
<p>
    There is deliberately no function in FRDL for completely
wiping a logger so this should be done manually using
Windows Explorer or equivalent.</p>
