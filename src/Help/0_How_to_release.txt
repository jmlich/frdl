Notes on releasing a new version of FRDL

After making mods to the point of a new release this
must be done:

1) Edit Help/2_15_Release_notes.html with details of changes
2) Edit FRDL/resources/App.properties Application.version=this release version.
3) Clean and build Main project in Netbeans
4) Start Packjacket and open FRDL Packjacket config.pjc
5) In PackJacket, amend General Info --> Application version to this release version.
6) Create jar and exe in Packjacket.  Names should be setup_FRDL_ver.jar and .exe
7) Save and close Packjacket
8) Create FRDL_ver.zip from /dist contents: FRDL.jar in the root and /lib subdir with all contents.
9) Move old versions of install .jar, .exe and .zip to somewhere safe.
10) Commit Subversion with note "Release xxx"
11) Copy jar, exe, zip files to dev flymicro.com.frdl/docs/downloads, delete old versions.
12) Copy any altered help files to dev flymicro.com.frdl/docs/FRDL_Help
13) Update flymicro.com online with above files.
14) Amend dev checkLatestVersion.cfm with latest release version
15) Update flymicro.com online with above file.

Done!

Extra notes:


Packjacket: http://packjacket.sourceforge.net/
Packjacket needs Izpack: http://izpack.org/

Works OK with Izpack 4.2.1 (earlier versions have Vista problems).
PackJacket is just a GUI for Izpack.

Beware of clever things like adding icons to shortcuts in Packjacket - seems to
cause problems with installing on Vista.
