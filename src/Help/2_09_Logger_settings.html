<h1>Logger settings</h1>

Logger settings are only available when a logger is connected.  <B>Do 
NOT disconnect a logger while the logger settings window is open.</B>
<p>
In Download-only mode all logger settings are read-only  (see <B>Modes of 
operation</B>).

<h2>Logger</h2>

The FRDL Id is the unique identifier FRDL gives to a logger the first 
time it is connected to FRDL. It is not editable.
<p>
The correct type of logger MUST be selected as the data retrieved from it 
may otherwise not be processed correctly.

<h2>Pilot</h2>

These fields must all be filled in correctly as they are used to generate 
the correct .igc output file according to the CIMA Specification.
<p>
<B>Name</B>: The usual protocol is to use the same name as used in the 
analysis and scoring systems which should be in the format Given Name <I>(lower case)</I> 
FAMILY NAME <I>(upper case)</I>.
<p>
<B>Nation</B>: The usual protocol is to use the FAI three letter code.  
(FAI is the same as the Olympic system which is slightly different to the ISO system, eg 
ISO - DEU = FAI - GER).
<p>
<B>Competition number</B>: The competition number of the pilot.  Must be less 
than 999 to meet the CIMA Specification.
<p>
<B>Primary secondary Etc.</B>:  Pilots often carry more than one logger on 
a competition flight.  This identifies which logger this one is.  The normal 
convention is that only the data from the pilot's primary logger is used in 
analysis unless there was some sort of technical fault in which case the 
secondary data is used.

<h2>Save</h2>

Saves the information to the configuration file on the logger.
