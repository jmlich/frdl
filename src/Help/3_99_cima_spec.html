<h1>The CIMA Specification</h1>

The FAI sporting code for microlights and paramotors is a combination of
the FAI General section and FAI Section 10.
<p>
    Annex 6 of FAI Section 10 <b>GNSS Flight Recorders and
    other electronic devices</b> contains the specification for
    flight recorders and the data they should produce.

</p>
<p>
    To be used in FAI championships without a special dispensation from the
    CIMA Flight Recorder Approval Committee (FRAC) each type of flight
    recorder, and its download software, must be tested by FRAC and be
    granted an approval document.
