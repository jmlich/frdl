<h1>Installing FRDL</h1>


FRDL requires <b>Java version 6</b> to be installed on your computer, and it probably
is already.  If you do not have this, it is available from
<b>http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</b>.  You need the Java
SE Runtime Environment (JRE).

<h2>Installing FRDL on a PC</h2>

FRDL has been tested on Windows 2000, XP and Vista.

<p>
    Download the file FRDLxx.zip file to your computer. (the xx indicates the
    version).
<p>
    Unzip the contents of the file to a location of your choice on your computer.
    The folder thus created should contain the file <b>FRDLxx.jar</b> and the
    sub-folder <b>lib</b> containing various libraries FRDL needs to run.
<p>
    Double click on FRDLxx.jar to start FRDL.   It is recommended a shortcut is
    created and placed in a convenient place such as the desktop.

<h2>Uninstalling FRDL on a PC</h2>

    Delete the folder containing the file <b>FRDLxx.jar</b> and the
    sub-folder <b>lib</b>.
    <br>
    Delete any shortcuts you may have made to FRDLxx.jar
    <br>
    FRDL is now completely removed from the PC.



<h2>Installing FRDL on Mac, Linux, Solaris Etc.</h2>

    In principle, FRDL should work on all these platforms, however it is
    currently not tested on any of them.  It is known that FRDL will <b>not</b>
    work on a Mac with OSX 10.4.11 because there is no Java version 6 available
    for it (only version 5), however, version 6 is available for more modern
    Mac OS's.
<p>
    The developer would be interested to hear of any experiences of using FRDL
    on non-Windows platforms.
