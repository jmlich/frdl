<h1>Disconnecting a logger</h1>

As far as your operating system is concerned, loggers compatible with FRDL
behave the same as an ordinary memory stick; in other words, when you plug it
in, the operating system 'mounts' it as a kind of removable drive available
to the operating system.
<p>
When it comes to disconnecting the logger, different
operating systems have different behaviour, but it is always very important
to do whatever the operating system needs.  It is thought that Vista and XP
are fairly tolerant of you just pulling the plug, but Windows 2000 will 
bitterly complain, as will some Macs, Linux Etc.
<p>
You may ask "Why should I be bothered, I always just pull the plug on memory
sticks", but you should be bothered, because not everything might have been
written to or read from the logger properly otherwise.  On Windows 2000 for example,
you can merrily delete files on a memory stick in Windows Explorer,
but if you just pull the plug before the stick is 'closed' properly by
'ejecting' it from the item in the task bar, not only will Windows 2000
complain, but the next time you plug it in you will find the files you
deleted weren't deleted at all!
<p>
FRDL writes important configuration information to the logger every time 
it is connected.  To avoid problems with this not being saved correctly to 
the logger <b>always eject the logger according to the requirements of
your operating system.</b>
