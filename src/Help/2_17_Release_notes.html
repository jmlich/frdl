<h1>FRDL release notes</h1>

<p><b>0.27</b> xx Apr 2009:
<br>
Pilot EVents (PEVs) now shown as a circular icon on the map when the
MARK button is pressed.<br>


<p><b>0.26</b> 9 Apr 2009:

and not recording altitude or fix validity.<br>

Help improvements.<br>


<p><b>0.25</b> 28 Mar 2009:
<br>
Revised the installer now using Packjacket / izPack<br>
    - .exe installer so it installs correctly on Vista.<br>
    - no need to uninstall earlier versions.

<p><b>0.24</b> 28 Mar 2009:
<br>
Added splash screen.

<p><b>0.23</b> 26 Mar 2009:

<p><b>0.22</b> 26 Mar 2009:
<br>
Improved support for GeoChron
<br>
Improved error trapping for unrecognized NMEA lines
<br>
Added warning if a task is set to extend over more than
one UTC day.  No problem for FRDL, but can be a problem in
the output igc file format because there is no
properly defined way of changing day half way through
a track, therefore some analysis programs may
show the portion of track after midnight BEFORE the
portion of track before midnight...

<p><b>0.21</b> 25 Mar 2009:

Non contiguous tracks are displayed with gaps if the
gap is more than 30 sec.
