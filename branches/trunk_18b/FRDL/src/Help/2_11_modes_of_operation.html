<h1>Modes of operation</h1>

<h2>Full mode</h2>
FRDL is normally in full mode, which means you have full control
over all settings.
<p>
If you set a password in <B>Championship settings</B> then FRDL will 
be in full mode with any loggers it encounters which have a matching 
password.
<p>
A conpetition organization will normally be running in in full 
mode with a password.  In this mode, FRDL copies all its 
key configuration data like task window settings 
to the logger.

<h2>Download-only mode</h2>

If the passwoed doesn't match, you are asked if you 
want to go into Download-only mode.
<p>
This mode is designed for pilots and team leaders at 
championships so they can download the exact same data as the 
organization.
<p>
The organizer's settings are retrieved by FRDL in 
download mode and used to produce the resulting 
.igc file output on the pilot or team leader's 
computer using the exact same settings as 
the organization.  

<h2>Getting out of Download-only mode</h2>

The password should be entered in FRDL.  It would be 
normal for an organizer to release the password at the 
end of a championship.
